# üìà Sales Forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA Models

This project focuses on building time series forecasting models to predict future sales using ARIMA and SARIMA techniques. The goal is to provide accurate sales forecasts that can help businesses make better inventory and financial planning decisions.

## üß† Overview
Time series analysis is essential for understanding patterns like seasonality, trends, and cycles in business data. In this project, we apply statistical models such as ARIMA and SARIMA to historical sales data and forecast future values.

---



## üéØ Objectives
- Explore and visualize sales trends and seasonality.
- Make the time series stationary using transformations and differencing.
- Tune ARIMA/SARIMA hyperparameters using ACF and PACF plots.
- Forecast sales and evaluate model accuracy using RMSE/AIC/BIC.
- Compare models and identify the best-fit approach.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Time series plots, trend/seasonal decomposition.
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values
   - Log transformations
   - Differencing to achieve stationarity
3. **Modeling**  
   - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
   - Parameter selection using ACF/PACF and Grid Search
4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - AIC / BIC for model comparison
5. **Forecasting**  
   Visualization of future forecasts along with confidence intervals

## üõ† Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- statsmodels
- pmdarima (optional for auto-ARIMA)

---

## üìä Results
- SARIMA outperformed ARIMA due to seasonal components in the sales data.
- Visualizations clearly show forecast alignment with actual sales trends.
